IUST - Distributed Systems - Fall 1400

======================================

Note: This project is heavily based on the following Github repo as it is the only implementation that I have learnt how to implement RAFT and how it works clearly:
https://github.com/Oaklight/Vesper

To run the servers:

python3 server.py 0
python3 server.py 1
python3 server.py 2
python3 server.py 3
python3 server.py 4

To run the clients:

- to distribute a value between servers: 	python3 client.py http://127.0.0.1:5002 myname "Soroush"
- to retrieve the value of a key from servers: 	python3 client.py http://127.0.0.1:5002 myname
# These will redirect your request to the leader anyway
